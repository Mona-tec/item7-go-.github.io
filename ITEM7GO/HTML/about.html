                    Welcome to Item7Go, your number one stop for delicious, freshly prepared Nigerian meals. We are more 
                    than just a restaurant — we are a celebration of authentic African flavors, warm hospitality, 
                    and the joy of good food shared with family and friends.
                    
                    At Item7Go, we believe that food is not just something you eat — 
                    it’s an experience, a story, and a feeling of home. 
                    Every dish we serve carries a piece of Nigeria’s rich culture,
                     cooked with passion, care, and a deep respect for tradition.

    <h2> Our Story</h2>
    <div class="content">
        Item7Go was born from a simple idea — to make tasty, 
        home-style Nigerian meals easily accessible to everyone, 
        anytime, anywhere. We noticed how busy life can get, and how hard it is to find real, 
        satisfying meals that remind you of home. So, we created a place where great food meets convenience.
        
        From humble beginnings, our goal has always been the same: to serve happiness through every plate.
         Whether you’re craving smoky jollof rice, rich egusi soup, or tender grilled chicken, 
         we make sure every bite delivers that authentic taste of home.
